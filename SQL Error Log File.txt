‚ùå Error Message Summary
 
Msg 547: The INSERT statement conflicted with the FOREIGN KEY constraint "FK__Payme

‚úÖ How to Fix It
Option 1: Check actual LoanIDs before inserting
Run this first to verify which IDs exist:

 
SELECT LoanID, BookID, MemberID FROM Loan;
Then insert only values with valid LoanIDs. For example:

 
-- Let‚Äôs say the LoanID for (BookID 3, MemberID 1) is actually 5:
INSERT INTO Payment (LoanID, PaymentDate, Amount, PaymentMethod)
VALUES (5, '2024-03-18', 2.00, 'Cash');


üõ†Ô∏è How to Simulate Unavailable Books (e.g., Issued books)
If a book is on loan (LoanStatus = 'Issued'), you may want to mark it unavailable:

 
-- Mark BookID 1 as unavailable (e.g., it's on loan)
UPDATE Book
SET IsAvailable = 0
WHERE BookID = 1;
Then re-run your query:

 
SELECT BookID, Title
FROM Book
WHERE IsAvailable = 0;
You should now see the book(s) you marked.

üß† Automation Tip (optional)
To sync availability with loan status, you could run:

UPDATE Book
SET IsAvailable = 0
WHERE BookID IN (
    SELECT BookID
    FROM Loan
    WHERE LoanStatus = 'Issued'
);

Developer Reflection 
At the end of the project, reflect on: 
‚Ä¢  What part was the most difficult? 
‚Ä¢ Which SQL command (DDL, DML, DQL) did you learn the most from? 
‚Ä¢  What did you discover from your error logs that made you think like a real developer?
Ans:
 
* **Most difficult part:** Writing complex queries with joins and conditions was the hardest.
* **Most learning from:** I learned the most from DQL commands and real-life data queries.
* **Error log insight:** Errors taught me to think like a developer by debugging constraints and logic.
